# T-cep
Transcription factor-associated Combinatorial Epigenetic Patterns (T-cep) is a collection of tools for training a univariate first-order hidden Markov model (HMM) over multiple epigenetic data sets to find combinatorial epigenetic regulation patterns. We have used T-cep successfully to find transcription factor (TF)-associated states in several cell lines. If you wish to focus on TF-associated states (downstream of T-cep), we recommend that only the TF of interest be used, although T-cep supports multiple TFs.
